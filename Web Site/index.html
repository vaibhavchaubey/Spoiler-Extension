                  But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts,
                  lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow
                  managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters
                  that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The
                  use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes
                  there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at
                  the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space
                  ship...<br /><br />The past thanos part wasn't necessary when
                  you think about it, they could've done this film without a
                  real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take
                  on a super hero film without using the same formula we have
                  seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle
                  felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more
                  characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle
                  from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final
                  battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc..
                  mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of
                  trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a
                  rehash.<br /><br />To me the best part of the film was the
                  first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and
                  trying to figure out how to continue on. really interesting
                  themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending.
                  And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've
                  been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos
                  within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just
                  a side character that gets in the way a little bit.<br /><br />And
                  the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved
                  actors and characters we have come to associate with these
                  films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase
                  in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I
                  just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any
                  charisma or depth.<br /><br />To me this feels like a closing
                  of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix.
                  I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone
                  films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not
                  be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy
                  films.<br /><br />It seems i maybe in the minority for my
                  feelings towards this film, but im not sugar coating my
                  opinion like it seems a few people are doing due to nostalgia.
                  Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be better,
                  maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible
                  reflects on my score to... Because i just don't give two cents
                  about any of them

                  Rating: 8.6<br /><br />Not as good as Infinity war
                  pacing-wise, but is a satisfying ending to the saga. High
                  production quality, and a great soundtrack like its
                  predecessor. The final fight did feel a little cliché (two
                  armies brainlessly charging at each other for a typical
                  smackdown). Not much to write about, it made every marvel
                  movie before it worth the ticket.

                  So it all ends. I have loved most of the MCU, some have been
                  too predictable but I awaited after IW to see how it would all
                  pan out. Firstly some of my favourite characters are a joke.
                  Please don't dumb Thor or Banner/Hulk down, not necessary.
                  Great starting scene, then slow dramatic next 1.5 hours. It
                  builds to the time travel reversing all section with too many
                  plot holes. We've all seen other time reversing movies who
                  have done it so much better. The last hour is spectacular,
                  great to see all the gang back but it feels rushed. Emotion
                  runs high and defo not a kids film in my eyes. Cap is great
                  Stark is amazing but everyone else feels like there just
                  there. What I loved was the beauty of the final scenes,
                  wonderful score and saying goodbye to old friends. Overall
                  wanted more, but even far from perfect is still pretty good.

                  After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers
                  Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes
                  would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many
                  theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers
                  Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent
                  years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the
                  probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for
                  Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the
                  film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has
                  disappeared.<br /><br />On the other hand, another comparison
                  comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can
                  comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning
                  of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we
                  shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories.
                  There is only one story divided into two parts.<br /><br />Avengers
                  Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history
                  of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the
                  original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk,
                  Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No
                  character comes in front of them. Of course there are many
                  characters that play an important role in the story outside
                  the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that
                  Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world,
                  overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did
                  not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how
                  strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore
                  in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a
                  family.<br /><br />Of course, Avengers Endgame has some
                  critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period
                  necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head
                  of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags
                  the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is
                  rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more
                  meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action
                  packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't
                  even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really
                  successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual
                  effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but
                  in general the story is so successful that these details
                  become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.<br /><br />Lastly,
                  Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after
                  the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The
                  Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is
                  the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
                  Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes
                  us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10

                  Perhaps Infinity War was the film of Thanos in which he
                  imposed what he was seeking, but Endgame is the movie of
                  Avengers who impose what they seek, and perhaps his title,
                  which translates to "the end of the game" means the end of
                  what Thanos sought. But do you think that would be that easy?
                  Contrary to what Thanos did quite easily? you are wrong! The
                  Infinite War movie may have been very touching and shocking
                  when Thanos killed half of the universe creatures, but the
                  endgame is more impactful and shocking than him. Although the
                  cuff will be in the interest of the Avengers in this movie,
                  nothing comes for free, must be given to get, and perhaps the
                  long time period for the movie that reached three hours was
                  very reasonable because their journey to achieve their goal
                  was neither easy nor many options in front of them.

                  If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even
                  spoiler free reviews. Which is why I'm not going to say
                  anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going
                  to say is:<br /><br />The crowd applauded 3 times during the
                  movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have
                  never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually
                  passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting,
                  and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people
                  with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the
                  movie.

                  The film has too many references to previous Marvel films, and
                  is not friendly to those who are not Marvel fans. General
                  audiences may easily get confused: what is this and why is
                  that? The story is not original either. We have seen too many
                  time-travel films, such as Back to the Future and Days of
                  Future Past. This film does not offer anything new. Besides,
                  the last thirty minutes are kind of redundant, and the overall
                  running time is unnecessarily long.

                  Well first off, Infinity War is one of my favourite movies of
                  all time, and I feel the expectations I had built from that,
                  has impacted how I feel about this movie.<br /><br />Their are
                  some really beautiful scenes and some great fan service which
                  deserves a mention, in a movie that feels like a stepping
                  stone to promote some of the characters that recently failed
                  in the comics. We are entering the get woke, go broke phase of
                  the MCU<br /><br />Now onto the movie:<br /><br />The plot
                  line is all over the place and they made the mistake of using
                  time travel to fix the universes problems, there are no
                  consequences for failure anymore in the mcu, because just like
                  in Dragon all we can just "Wish back" all those who died. Its
                  basically Back To The Future, the Thanos edition.<br /><br />Once
                  again, they sideline Thor and The Hulk by using them purely as
                  a punchline for lame, low IQ jokes in a corny script that
                  feels like it is trying to be so many things, but doesn't
                  quite hit the mark. Thor spends the entire movie as a whiny,
                  fat child with mommy issues<br /><br />Although there were
                  some very nice, touching moments to the movie I feel like most
                  of the mourning and brooding could have been condensed into a
                  montage in order for us to see the heroes do, exactly what we
                  came to see the heroes do, fight bad guys. There's very little
                  in the way of action and because the story was so all over the
                  place, I left feeling like nothing was actually accomplished
                  in this movie.<br /><br />As always Tony is amazing, throwing
                  out one liners and nicknames and Captain America is great
                  too.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed many aspects of it,
                  but at the same time I felt like there was no control over the
                  plot. Like they were more concerned with paying homage to
                  EVERY character ever, before writing a great narrative.

                  Don't get me wrong, the movie was great, but would I watch it
                  a second time? Probably not - until the DVD comes out.<br /><br />I've
                  seen infinity war at least 5 times, and it's one of my
                  favorite films.<br /><br />That being said, i will compare the
                  two movies for sure, and I just disliked the pacing, it was
                  all over the place. Some Characters felt off, and some got
                  little to no screen time, where others had too much.<br /><br />It's
                  just too many characters for one movie, even though infinity
                  war did it much better, with just as many characters. I just
                  can't put my finger on it.<br /><br />The fighting scenes were
                  alright, the first half lacked action, but the second half
                  delivered some good solid scenes, nothing groundbreaking, but
                  fun to watch. They can't reinvent the wheel, neither do they
                  want to. They stick to what works, and that's alright.<br /><br />All
                  in all, the movie was a close 8/10, the fanboys who give it a
                  10 are just blind to accept the mistakes the movie made. It's
                  not a perfect film, even an 8 is really generous in my
                  opinion. The Movie works with nostalgia and gives fans of the
                  MCU the things they wanted, more or less.<br /><br />Still
                  thinking Thor 3 was the best MCU movie. Sue me.

                  I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am
                  disappointed.<br /><br />I loved Civil War and I loved
                  Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew
                  immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them
                  again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.<br /><br />I respect how
                  they were prepared to show the consequences of what Thanos had
                  done but by killing him off so quickly and then them having to
                  do their own stone quest (hadn't we already seen Thanos doing
                  this in IW) it felt slow and lazy. Worse still was that it
                  felt very self-indulgent and attempting to be clever for
                  clever sake.<br /><br />Like how Back to the Future II
                  considered itself clever for showing the events of the first
                  film but with Marty flitting around behind the scenes to
                  ensure that it all still happened. I know it's meant to be fan
                  pleasing but it really felt like a gimmick and lacking in
                  confidence. Almost like it was saying 'Hey guys, this will
                  make you smile'. If you want to make me smile, concentrate on
                  maintaining the quality of your product rather than directly
                  trying to make me like you.<br /><br />But the trouble with
                  messing around with timelines and bouncing around is that it
                  makes the audience start asking questions during the film. The
                  linearity that we'd seen in IW and the imminent fast
                  approaching threat is replaced in Endgame with a lack of
                  direction and characters that are earlier versions of who the
                  audience have seen.<br /><br />In IW we were shown Thanos. He
                  was written to be sympathetic or at least a character that we
                  the audience could understand. He believed in what he was
                  doing and this made him more rounded. But in Endgame, that
                  version is dispatched quickly and we are supplied with a 2014
                  (?) Thanos who isn't the character we know but is just a token
                  bad guy.<br /><br />This Thanos hasn't made the sacrifice at
                  Vormire, he isn't the guy that would empathise with Scarlet
                  Witch for what she did to Vision. He has suddenly become a
                  token cut out evil bad guy that needs to be defeated. Hell,
                  the writers even manage to forget their own time loop by
                  saying that this Thanos has learnt that he doesn't want to
                  wipe out 50% anymore because they are too ungrateful. How does
                  he know this when the 2014 Thanos has only just literally
                  arrived in the post wipeout Universe? How has he had time to
                  form the opinion that his previous quest for a 50% cull isn't
                  worthy?<br /><br />Is this a case of the writers being
                  terrified that they had created a bad guy that people related
                  to or was it a fear that they'd written themselves into a
                  hole? Why go to the effort of creating that character in IW to
                  suddenly kill him off at the beginning of Endgame just for a
                  dramatic punch?<br /><br />For me, the time travelling and
                  stone gathering wasted time to create unimportant scenes that
                  fundamentally undermine the films that came before. In my
                  opinion it would have been better if they had shown the
                  remaining Avengers preparing to do some Avenging and
                  maintained the single minded linearity of IW of battling
                  towards and reaching a post click Thanos and somehow reversing
                  his work.<br /><br />The more I think of the film, the more
                  plot holes and frustrations manifest themselves. Thor's
                  drinking and man child antics might have been initially funny
                  but one begins to realise that they are deliberately doing
                  this to clip his wings. Likewise with Hulk, his primordial
                  desire to smash and destroy has been removed to think it out
                  and he has become an embarrassing shadow of his former
                  self.<br /><br />The thing that is meant to be amazing about
                  the MCU is the world building but inconsistencies have been
                  appearing and there are so many in Endgame that it makes you
                  question whether these two films are written by the same
                  people.<br /><br />In IW, Thanos is a dangerous and credible
                  threat because he has the infinity stones. He takes on half of
                  the Avengers, Strange and some of the Guardians on Titan and
                  smashes them and then takes on the other half on Wakanda and
                  smashes them. Yet it is Stormbreaker (whose creation we have
                  seen been hard earned by a motivated Thor) that has the power
                  to take down Thanos even when he has a full complement of
                  Infinity Stones.<br /><br />Yet we roll forward to Endgame and
                  we have literally all the good guys together in one place, Cap
                  with his shield, Tony fully powered up, Scarlet Witch p*ssed
                  and vengeful, Capt Marvel who can seemingly do anything and
                  Thor wielding both Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker and Thanos NOT in
                  possession of the gauntlet, yet they can't defeat him.<br /><br />It's
                  like the fights in IW were so amazing because the good guys
                  were taking on an unbeatable foe yet here he is now seemingly
                  defeatable by the 'rules' that the writers established . A
                  good example of this would be in IW when Cap is the last man
                  standing before Scarlet Witch and he grabs the gauntlet. You
                  see the look of admiration/respect on Thanos' face that Cap is
                  holding open the gauntlet before he punches him to the ground
                  yet now that scene seems pointless.<br /><br />The writers for
                  Endgame seem to have been driven to undo everything they did
                  in IW. All the tension, all the sacrifice, all the development
                  of Thanos discarded for well, I don't know what. It makes no
                  sense.<br /><br />IW had two incredible scenes that used to
                  choke me up. When Cap appears in the train station, the
                  Avengers theme kicks in and Falcon and Widow take down the
                  henchman in a wonderfully choreographed scene. In just that
                  one scene it shows them coming to the rescue, it shows how
                  intuitively they work together and it showcases their
                  heroism.<br /><br />Likewise when Thor creates Stormbreaker
                  and makes his entrance on Wakanda, I felt it for the journey
                  that Thor has been on. He's had to contend with loss and
                  defeat and humiliation and this is his redemption. Here is a
                  character that has earned his game changing weapon and when he
                  arrives and demands to face a character that everyone else is
                  running away from, I want to punch the air.<br /><br />But in
                  Endgame, that feels like it has to be corrupted. We can't have
                  Thor being dominant, let's break him and make him a fool. We
                  can't have Thanos being complicated and relatable, let's make
                  him a cut out bad guy. We can't have Hulk being rage fuelled
                  and smashing stuff up, let's make him more sensitive and
                  talking stuff out. We can't have Cap being stoic and heroic,
                  let's have him ridiculing one of his own iconic lines in a
                  silly gimmicky fight with himself and commenting on his butt.
                  We can't have a powerful female character that we're invested
                  in look sexy AND be able to take down Thanos, let's give
                  Scarlet Witch a small part but focus our attention on a female
                  character that hasn't earnt our admiration or desire for
                  revenge.<br /><br />To be honest, the 'rules of engagement'
                  had been set so well in IW that when in Endgame Thanos massed
                  his ranks against the Avengers and then ALL of the good guys
                  showed up, I was almost expecting the camera to pull away and
                  not show the fight given that it was so obviously going to be
                  an easy win for the good guys.<br /><br />And as for the big
                  fight scene, it did reek of what DC always manage to do which
                  is just throw everything into an end battle and bludgeon you
                  with CGI and pyrotechnics so that you aren't really sure what
                  is going on.<br /><br />In the many fights in IW, you knew
                  what was going on, you recognised the combatants, you
                  understood the stakes and you identified the geography of the
                  scene. In Endgame we got one big massive fight where
                  everything was thrown in the pot and it was just assumed by
                  the directors that we would be happy with all the flashing
                  lights. And I have to say that considering that Steve and Tony
                  fell out so hard, and that Tony's criticism of Steve was so
                  unfair, that I really had hoped for more than just a
                  handshake, a muttering of 'no worries' and 'here's your
                  shield'. These guys wrote and directed Civil War, they created
                  the line 'we fell out hard' and hence I had hoped for
                  something deeper and more touching than a handshake.<br /><br />Steve
                  wrote Tony a letter telling him that when he needed him he'd
                  be there but once again the Iron Man bias had to creep in and
                  once again Tony was the victim and the ultimate hero.<br /><br />But
                  I think my biggest problem is how the convenient time
                  travelling undermines everything. When a franchise starts
                  retrofitting stuff (like Fury's eye being from a space cat),
                  it's then hard to consider the previous stories.<br /><br />Having
                  2014 Gamorra means that all the evolution that we saw her go
                  through in GOTG 1 and 2 is wasted. Having Cap marry Peggy
                  means the pain of his sacrifice, him seeing her in Winter
                  Soldier when she is suffering from Alzheimer's, hell even his
                  blossoming relationship with Sharon Carter is kinda
                  irrelevant. Having seen Thor at last step away from his two
                  weaker origin films into the entertainment of Ragnarok and the
                  redemption in IW leaves us now with a bumbling buffoon.<br /><br />We
                  know that what makes Captain America what he is, is the serum
                  that makes him a super soldier. That he was transformed from a
                  weakling to a superhuman. Sam Wilson is not a super soldier
                  and he didn't take the serum. He is Falcon. Now maybe in the
                  comics he becomes Cap but Bucky is a super soldier. Is the new
                  Cap going to foil an evil plot and be defeated with a tazer or
                  a knife to the chest? Consider the beatings that Steve has
                  taken and the physical strength that he has shown we can
                  recognise that Sam Wilson does not have that.<br /><br />I'm
                  sorry to say but the Russo's have dropped the ball. Themselves
                  and their writers have succumbed to their success and their
                  desire to be engineers of political correctness and social
                  change. I thought Endgame would be the high soaring end to
                  this 10 year run of impressive movie entertainment but in the
                  end the writers got carried away, the directors over reached
                  and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product for a
                  chance to 'educate' us all. A real shame and a wasted
                  opportunity.<br /><br />Infinity War is clearly the highlight
                  of the last 10 years but even now I fear that repeated
                  viewings will render it pointless considering how the makers
                  decided to fundamentally damage it.

                  I have watched the first part many, many times. Every minute

                  I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about
                  Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say
                  about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing
                  it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview
                  screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words.<br /><br />I'm
                  not your average fanboy -- most long-running franchises have
                  bored me at this point, and I couldn't care less about the
                  newest Star Wars episode or whether there will be another film
                  set in the Harry Potter universe.<br /><br />But Marvel films
                  have been consistently watchable, with many solid entries and
                  a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first
                  Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after Infinity War
                  ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the
                  conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed!<br /><br />Very few
                  highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers:
                  Endgame is one of them. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity
                  War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. It's
                  hard to see how they'll be able to top this one.<br /><br />It's
                  surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is
                  headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there),
                  emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater)
                  and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I've laughed
                  in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok). Visually speaking,
                  it's a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the 'epic
                  battle' stakes), and even though it's three hours long, it
                  doesn't feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my watch was
                  because I was hoping there would be more time before the
                  end.<br /><br />Yes, it's a superhero movie, but an immensely
                  entertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the
                  pictures that came before it: there are tons of references and
                  inside jokes to reward the faithful).<br /><br />If "Return of
                  the King" managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars
                  Avengers: Endgame deserves at least a nomination. It's as good
                  (and in many ways better) a conclusion to a fantasy/genre
                  series as the Peter Jackson film,.<br /><br />Go see it.

                  Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to
                  end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that
                  was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is
                  gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you
                  have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did,
                  I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point. In
                  the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight,
                  say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even
                  manage to say profoundly philosophical statements... The
                  quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are
                  done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as
                  they went on. Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3
                  hours to find that out.

                  I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames
                  and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous
                  and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking
                  myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I
                  guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one
                  line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at
                  all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that
                  unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could
                  have spent on basically anything else and it would have been
                  more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to
                  watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing
                  I guess.

                  Unfortunately clumsy. I enjoyed all previous Avengers, and a
                  few scenes in this are very cool and funny, but this one
                  lowers the bar overall. For me the story petered out instead
                  of maintained momentum from previous movies. The dialogue
                  struggles to be interesting, boring sequences at time.<br /><br />Clumsy
                  Avengers fit awkwardly together for group photo, like bad high
                  school reunion. That said, I enjoy Avengers like everyone else
                  for years, just not this one so much.<br /><br />The
                  super-power woman, Capt Marvel, her powers are overdone. Too
                  simplistic, too much power. No reason for her to lose any
                  fight.<br /><br />Was a big collective of all heroes even
                  necessary? Sort of not really.<br /><br />Some scenes linger
                  way too long, drawing out already thin content. And where was
                  Dr Strange? He hardly had anything to say, and very brief
                  appearance, yet he was in possession of crucial aspect of
                  story.

                  Only a month or so back I was talking to a friend about how
                  much I hate it when serious movies use time travel to get
                  their characters out of problems. I have no problem with
                  movies like 'Back to the Future' or 'Hot Tub Time Machine'
                  that are both comedy based and use the time machine as a plot
                  for the movie as opposed to a solution for characters
                  problems. When a serious movie uses it though it as lazy as
                  writing as dream sequence in my opinion.<br /><br />At the end
                  of the day though that just underlines the problem with these
                  movies. The heroes are far too powerful. Whatever power they
                  need they simply possess conveniently. Heck, 'Dr Strange' can
                  even see into the future to know exactly what to do to make
                  sure everything turns out alright. If that isn't the stupidest
                  thing I've ever seen in a movie I don't know what is.<br /><br />I
                  felt like the movie went very much as expected as well. Sure
                  some characters die, however they were pretty much telegraphed
                  to do so long before the movie came out. There also seemed to
                  be a lack of conflict as key moments. A lot of things went far
                  too smoothly for my liking in terms of the plan. Finally, the
                  ending with 'Iron Man' simply pulling the glove off 'Thanos' -
                  what the hell was that? Was that supposed to be clever
                  writing? 'Thanos' just standing there for an eternity doing
                  nothing waiting for someone to stop him?<br /><br />A lot of
                  the jokes failed to land too. This was a surprisingly unfunny
                  movie. In a 3 hour movie I got maybe 3 light chuckles out of
                  the film. Every joke just felt so forced and some of the
                  characters who don't have a comedy background delivered them
                  very poorly. 'Avengers: Endgame' is three hours of my life I
                  would like back.
