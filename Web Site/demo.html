         Not as good as infinity war..

               But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the
               cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to
               accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been
               cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in
               this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some
               reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex
               machina a space ship...<br /><br />The past thanos part wasn't
               necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film
               without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original
               take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen
               in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a
               rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos -
               basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider
               man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america,
               thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes
               of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a
               rehash.<br /><br />To me the best part of the film was the first act
               and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out
               how to continue on. really interesting themes that followed the pay
               off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the
               heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small
               parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again.
               But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.<br /><br />And
               the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and
               characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not
               get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon,
               Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at
               all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.<br /><br />To me
               this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for
               my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand
               alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be
               happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.<br /><br />It
               seems i maybe in the minority for my feelings towards this film, but
               im not sugar coating my opinion like it seems a few people are doing
               due to nostalgia. Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be
               better, maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible
               reflects on my score to... Because i just don't give two cents about
               any of them
